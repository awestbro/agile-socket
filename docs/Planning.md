Design
======

I want to be able to use Socket.IO as a base for the Agile planning application prototype. 

Using the code from index.js and chat.js, I can emit and recieve unique commands via parsing in the chat.js client. 

## TODO

Seperate the socket IO logic out of the index.js file. 

Find a way to save dashboard state. Possibly routing it to Mongoose. on update, delete, etc. 

Use Angular binding to pull in and take care of new data
